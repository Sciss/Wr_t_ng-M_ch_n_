# algorithm

- it only makes sense if there is some coherence between the channels
- although it has overhead, the "simplest" way would be that the complete
  phrase is relayed from channel to channel
- then each node maintains their individual database (this could even be
  using different radio frequencies)

## to-do

- AGC
- relaying
- proper db-span selection
- occasional front/back trim
- alsamixer set volume
